The character that sends in the chicken for her "egg" is the one that keeps cloning the PC chicken once it dies.

# Mechanics

* How many eggs of the available targets are collected. Say 4/4 eggs

## Win / Loose conditions
* Catch 3-4 eggs inside the museum and bring them out to the get-away van.
* It's on a timer and you can only carry one egg at a time
* Once you delievered the first egg (OPT: or a guard notices the egg missing from it's pedestal) the police timer starts
* Police timer is a countdown from ex: 30-60s until the police arrives and it's an automatic fail. You only get away with X amount of eggs you had already gotten into the van.
* Once you run up to the escape van the mastermind unloads the egg for you and back in you go unless you have collected all the eggs.

## Death / Caught
In the museum there will be guards protecting the valuables inside.
